# React + TypeScript + Vite

Some Explanation for this project:

Decided to go with vite, a simple client side project is the best for this app.

Next js would have been ok, but the point is to interact and expose api data to the frontend.

Our routing will be managed using react-router.
Our states will be managed by zustand/Reactquery. React-query might be a overkill for this app but i it will manage error and loading states for me plus its standard in the industry.

MileStones:
Get the data to fetch.
Necessary api calls with types, top movies, top series, romance, comedy.
UI for Main page, 4 couressel
Get routing working to redirect to other pages with param.
Install state management zustand and React Query, keep state of selected element selected.
Second Screen
Optional:
Search with searchParams, maybe debounce for request.
